# LaTeX Writing

LaTeX is a document preparation and typesetting system that is used in Computer Science, and throughout the publishing industry, to prepare the content of books, papers, and articles. Rather than just typing up everything in Microsoft Word, which can become a pain when you need to write anything longer than a single page, you can use LaTeX. However, because LaTeX is more complicated than just writing and visually manipulating your text in a WYSIWYG style, we will need to learn about the system. Remember, we all got taught to use Word years ago, we didn't just learn it because it's the easiest tool to use. So, it is worth learning an arguably better and more reliable system. Also, two other great reasons to learn LaTeX, you will probably have to write some reports in LaTeX in modules you take in the future so this means one less thing to learn about later, and most importantly, the a LaTeX document is just plain text, albeit marked up. This means that we can store our LaTeX documents in Git so that we have backups and can collaborate with others whilst writing.

LaTeX is mostly used as a command-line tool with a good editor, however, to give you a gentle introduction we shall use a browser based online tool called [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/).

Your task is to create a ShareLaTeX account and to write a short LaTeX document using the ShareLaTeX tools. Add the LaTeX source code to a Git repository, and send the final PDF file to your tutor (either [Simon](s.wells@napier.ac.uk) or [Neil](n.urquhart@napier.ac.uk)). The text of your document can be a written up version of your review from the reviewing topic or a version of one of your blog posts from the Blogging topic.
