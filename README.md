# Personal Development Tutoring Materials

Materials for each week are stored in the repo. Each week includes a notes.md file which describes the tasks for that week. We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/wiki) (in the sidebar to the right) which includes links to additional, old, provisional, or prospective materials such as the list of potential papers for the critical reading exercise in Week 6. We can also use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/issues) (again, in the sidebar to the right) to comment on the PDT materials and suggest improvements. You can of course clone this repository and improve it if you like then, when you are ready, issue a pull request if you want us to consider your changes for incorporation into the main branch.

## One to one meetings
We'll also meet for individual discussions about your progress. The first meeting is usually around the time that the first assignment grades are returned in first trimester. The second meeting is usually around the middle/end of the second trimester, to reflect on the first year, and to look forward to second year.

+ Trimester 01, Weeks 08 & 09 - During this period we run [1-to-1 sessions](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/tree/master/reflection) so that we can reflect privately upon how the first trimester is developing and plan any adjustments that might be necessary to help you excel.
+ Trimester 02, Weeks 08 & 09 - A second round of [1-to-1 sessions](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/tree/master/reflection) to help us to reflect on both the second trimester and the year as a whole.

We'll also meet on an ad hoc basis whenever necessary to resolve any problems that you experience and again in each trimester of subsequent years to help guide and support your journey through your degree.
