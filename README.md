# Personal Development Tutoring Materials

Materials for each week are stored in the repo. Each week includes a notes.md file which describes the tasks for that week. We also have a [wiki](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/wiki) (in the sidebar to the right) which includes links to additional, old, provisional, or prospective materials such as the list of potential papers for the critical reading exercise in Week 6. We can also use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/siwells/pdt_materials/issues) (again, in the sidebar to the right) to comment on the PDT materials and suggest improvements. You can of course clone this repository and improve it if you like then, when you are ready, issue a pull request if you want us to consider your changes for incorporation into the main branch.
