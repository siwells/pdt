We'll get together twice during Fresher's week

# First Meeting

We'll meeting in Webex and there will be two activities. 

## Two truths & a lie

The first activitiy is an ice breaker in which we'll introduce ourselves and get to know each other a little through the two truths and a lie exercise.

## Software Systems Groupwork

I'll assign you into groups of around three and give you until our next meeting to research, as groups, answers to the following questions:

1. What is the largest software system they can find? 
2. What is the most unusual place they can find a piece of software? 
3. What is the most important failure of a piece of software they can find?
4. What is the most interesting use of software you can find?

There aren't any right or wrong answers for this. I'm genuinely interested in what you find out and we'll use it as a starting place for discussion during our first physical meeting on Thursday.

# Second Meeting

During this meeting we'll discuss your findings from the groupwork then make sure everyone is ready for the start of teaching (and can find classrooms, timetables, toilets, etc) and take a campus tour.
