# Blogging

In week 3 we learnt Git and I suggested that you consider Git as a kind of portfolio of your code. Another way to sell yourself to potential clients or employers is through an online presence. There are many opportunities to have your own online presence such as through various social networking sites. However, to begin with we shall look at creating our own blogs, using free blogging services. Once we are comfortable with that then we can consider running our own static sites, putting the source code in Git, and hosting the site itself in GitHub.

## Blogging from a Blog Site

There are many free sites that will host a blog for you and don't expect you to know any HTML. Here are a few to get you started:

+ [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
+ [Weebly](http://www.weebly.com/)
+ [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)

Choose one, create an account, and start writing a first "Hello World" blog post, then publish it. Perhaps the subject of your first blog post could be "Why I want to study Computer Science". It doesn't have to be a long post. Other topics to consider are "Why I think Computer Science is important" and "Good and bad experiences from my first few weeks at Napier". If you don't like any of those topics then you can come up with your own ideas. Once you have published your blog post, email the address to your tutor group leader (either [Simon](s.wells@napier.ac.uk) or [Neil](n.urquhart@napier.ac.uk)).

## Github Website Hosting
You don't just have to use a free blog service to host your website. There are many alternatives ways to achieve similar results. For example, Simon use GitHub pages to host his [academic website](http://www.simonwells.org) and all of the source code for his site is stored in it's own [Git repo](https://github.com/siwells/simonwells.org) (NB. You have to look in the gh-pages branch of the repo to find the source code). You can find out more here:
