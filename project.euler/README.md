# Project Euler Week

This week let's write some code. You can use any language that you like so use the opportunity to either practise a language you alread know or else to learn a new language. Remember, the more code that you write then the better you will be and the more your skills will improve. The best coders whom I have had the opportunity to work with were all good programmers purely because they put a lot of time and effort into getting better at what they do. 

The task is to work through as many problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as you like. Make sure to create a Git repository and add the code that you write for each problem to your repo. then push it to your remote account (Bitbucket or Github).

I often use established problem lists as a way to learn a new language or to practise one I already know. There are many other similar sites that provide problem sets so if you can't think of a program to write then these places are a good starting point:

1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
2. [Stack Exchange Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)
3. [Code kata](http://codekata.com/)
4. [Reddit Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
5. [Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/)
6. [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page)
7. [International Collegiate Programming Contest Problems Index](http://acm.hit.edu.cn/problemset)
8. [Algorithmist](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Main_Page)


## Mini-Project Ideas ##

1. Vanilla JavaScript stopwatch - start | stop | reset
2. JavaScript clock - regular clock, 12 hour, 24 hour, world clock, alarm
3. JavaScript calculator - simple, scientific, specialist
4. JavaScript drum kit - Map keyboard to keys to specific drum sounds
5. Guess the Color game - Show RGB value, get player to click the matching colour swatch, easy/hard mode
6. Hangman game - Guess the word one letter at a time
7. Tic Tac Toe/Noughts & Crosses
8. Pong game
9. Pairs game - take turns to select two cards and see if they match
10. Maze game - generating mazes is fun (and a stepping stone towards generating rooms/level/dungeons for your dungeon crawler game.
11. Tip calculator/bill splitter
12. Palindrome checker
13. To-do list
14. JavaScript timeline
15. JavaScript quiz
16. JavaScript weather app - pull data from API and display it
17. JavaScript browser code editor
18. Text editor/Word processor
19. Narrative-based text adventure/choose-your-own-adventure game
20. Text-based Dungeon Crawler game
21. Password generator


## Challenging Project Ideas ##

These projects are a more serious test. I got the inspiration from them from Austin Z. Henley's list of [challenging projects every programmer should try](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/challengingprojects.html). Take a look at his site because he has some explanations of why it is worth attempting some of them.

1. Text editor
2. 2D game - Space Invaders
3. Compiler - Tiny BASIC
4. Mini operating system
5. Spreadsheet
6. Video game console emulator
7. Implement a Lisp
8. Implement a Forth
9. Implement a Logic Language (i.e. Kanren or Prolog)
