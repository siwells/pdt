# Project Euler Week

This week let's write some code. You can use any language that you like so use the opportunity to either practise a language you alread know or else to learn a new language. Remember, the more code that you write then the better you will be and the more your skills will improve. The best coders whom I have had the opportunity to work with were all good programmers purely because they put a lot of time and effort into getting better at what they do. 

The task is to work through as many problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) as you like. Make sure to create a Git repository and add the code that you write for each problem to your repo. then push it to your remote account (Bitbucket or Github).

I often use established problem lists as a way to learn a new language or to practise one I already know. There are many other similar sites that provide problem sets so if you can't think of a program to write then these places are a good starting point:

1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
2. [Stack Exchange Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)
3. [Code kata](http://codekata.com/)
4. [Reddit Daily Programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)
5. [Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/)
6. [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page)
7. [International Collegiate Programming Contest Problems Index](http://acm. hit.edu.cn/judge/ProblemIndex.php)
8. [Algorithmist](http://www.algorithmist.com/index.php/Main_Page)
