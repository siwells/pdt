# Reflection

Each trimester we meet in one-to-one sessions for a short chat. These are typically 15-20 minutes long and are an opportunity to reflect on progress, expecations, and achievements. If necessary, we use this as a starting place and add in additional dedicated time to further discuss, plan, and, if possible, resolve any issues or problems.

## Sessions

There are usually two one-to-one sessions during your first year with us. The first is towards the end of the first trimester and the second is towards the end of the second.

## Aims

Our goals during the one-to-one's are to:

1. Review any available module results (in first trimester this can include making sure you know how to find them in [eStudentRecords](https://evision.napier.ac.uk/)). If you've failed anything then we can look at reassessment arrangements.
2. Check attendance
3. Discuss progress on each module for the current trimester. We also look at how you're getting on with your coursework and what the assessment arrangements are.
4. Discuss anything else that you might need to raise.
