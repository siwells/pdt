# Programming a simple C64 Game

This session we'll follow [this tutorial](https://siwells.github.io/READY/topics/c64/) and build a simple bat and ball game for an emulated version of the Commodore 64, a popular vintage 8-bit machine from the 80s. We'll also play around with a few other bits of code along the way.
